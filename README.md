A literature review regarding the growing threat of mosquito-borne diseases with rising global tempatures, in the United States.

This paper is focused on synthesizing available data and research regarding the prevelance and impact of diseases transmitted by mosquitos, and proposes potentially effective methods of mitigating illness, and death caused by these infections.

The study also examines the potential spread of mosquitos across south-eastern regions of the United States, if strategies are not implemented to curb their populations across multiple states.

❗ **This is also a PSA, to dump your any sources of standing water during the summer to prevent mosquito larvae from developing into full-grown mosquitos!** ❗
